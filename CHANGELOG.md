# Changelog

All notable changes to the Midnight Indigo extension are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.0.0]

First release of the unified extension, and the first release published to the Visual Studio Marketplace.

### Added

- **Midnight Indigo Icons** is now part of this extension. It was previously distributed as a separate package (`midnight-indigo-icons`, v1.0.0) that had to be installed by hand. It contributes 222 SVG icons — 140 file/language icons and 40 contextual folder icons with open and closed variants.
- Marketplace metadata: publisher, license, repository, gallery banner and keywords.

### Changed

- The color theme and the icon theme are now a single installable extension. Both remain opt-in: the color theme is selected under *Preferences: Color Theme*, the icons under *Preferences: File Icon Theme*.
- All descriptions, the README and the changelog are now written in English.

### Migration

If you installed either theme manually by copying it into `~/.vscode/extensions`, remove the old `midnight-indigo` and `midnight-indigo-icons` folders before installing from the Marketplace, otherwise duplicate entries appear in the theme picker.

## [2.6.0] and earlier

Released as the standalone `midnight-indigo` color theme, distributed manually. No changelog was kept for those versions.
